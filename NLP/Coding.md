- The benefit of using AutoTokenizer is that it abstracts away the need to know the specific tokenizer class associated with each pre-trained model. Instead, it provides a convenient interface for loading tokenizers in a consistent manner across different models.

**OpenRouter** is a platform that provides access to various models, including but not limited to GPT models from OpenAI.

The warning suggests an inconsistency in the parameters passed to the model.generate() method. If you are setting temperature=0.0, it typically means you want deterministic output, which should not be used unless do_sample=True is also set. By setting temperature to a non-zero value and do_sample=True, you can generate more diverse outputs, or simply remove the temperature parameter if you don't intend to use sampling.

Handling Input Length:

Truncate or Segment Inputs: Before tokenizing the inputs, you should ensure they do not exceed 512 tokens. If they do, consider strategies like truncating the input or splitting it into manageable segments.


----------------------------------
 - **Setting the max_length parameter in the model.generate() method to be equal to the input length**: When the max_length parameter is set to a value that equals the length of the input_ids being passed in, it means there's no room allowed for the model to add any tokens, leading to the model generating nothing.
   
   To solve this issue, you need to ensure that max_length is greater than the length of your input_ids to give space for the model to generate a response. Alternatively, you can use the max_new_tokens parameter instead of max_length to specify how many new tokens you want the model to generate beyond the input length.

- **For Berts**: Make sure that the total length, including both the input and the maximum number of new tokens (max_new_tokens), does not exceed 512. If you're at the limit already with your input, you can't add more tokens without exceeding this boundary.

```python
result = {}
print(type(inputs))
for index, row in enumerate(inputs[20:]):
    print("salam")
    prompt = prompt_enhancements.format(order=row['foods'], comment=row['comment'], ingredients=row['materials'])
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": f"{system_role}"},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}"}]

    tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(messages, max_length=512, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate response, make sure to handle sampling and temperature correctly
    outputs = model.generate(tokenized_inputs.input_ids, max_length=512, temperature=1.0, do_sample=True)
    text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    # Save the response
    result[index + 90] = text  # Adjust the index if necessary
    print(f"{index + 90} Done.")
