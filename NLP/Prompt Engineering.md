- you don't necessarily need to use CTRL (Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable Generation) to perform prompt tuning on a model. While CTRL provides a unique mechanism for controlling text generation by specifying control codes in the prompt, **prompt tuning itself is a broader technique that can be applied to a variety of models, including but not limited to CTRL**.

### Understanding Prompt Tuning

**Prompt tuning** is a method where you fine-tune a pre-trained model by ==optimizing a set of prompt tokens== (also referred to as soft prompts) that are prepended to the input text. This technique alters the way the model processes inputs, effectively guiding it to generate outputs that are tailored to specific tasks or styles **without the need to modify the model’s core weights**.

### Alternatives for Prompt Tuning

1. **Soft Prompt Tuning**:
    
    - **Description**: This involves learning a set of artificial tokens that are not part of the actual input but are optimized during training to induce the desired behavior from the model. These tokens effectively become a part of the model's input for all tasks during the tuning phase.
    - **Applications**: Widely applicable across various models and tasks, allowing the model to adapt to specific requirements without extensive retraining.
2. **Hard Prompt Engineering**:
    
    - **Description**: This is a manual approach where you craft specific prompts or instructions that are included with each input to guide the model's responses. This method relies on human intuition and experimentation to find effective prompts.
    - **Applications**: Useful when you need to quickly adapt a model for a new task without any training, provided you can find effective prompts through trial and error.

### CTRL in the Context of Prompt Tuning

CTRL can be viewed as a specialized case of hard prompt engineering, where each control code effectively acts as a hard-coded prompt that directs the model’s generation process. However, using CTRL specifically for prompt tuning is limited to scenarios where you have predefined control codes that suit your needs, and you are using the CTRL model specifically.

--------------------------------------------------------

- Self Learning : To add the output of the previous data as the input prompt of the current data, this is done by the decoder function.

- Using the decoder function of a transformer model in a way that incorporates the output of previous data as input for the current data is a common strategy in sequence generation tasks like machine translation, text summarization, or chatbot conversation generation. This strategy is known as **autoregressive generation**. In autoregressive generation, the model outputs one token at a time, and each subsequent token is predicted based on the previously generated tokens.

### Step 1: Load the Model and Tokenizer

First, you need to load your model and its corresponding tokenizer. Here’s an example using the GPT-2 model, which can be adapted to other transformer models:

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode if not training

```

### Step 2: Encode Initial Input

Encode the initial input text that will start the generation process. This could be an empty string if you're generating text from scratch or some initial context:

```python
initial_text = "The science lecture"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(initial_text, return_tensors='pt')  # 'pt' for PyTorch

```

### Step 3: Generate Tokens Autoregressively

You can now generate text by feeding the output of the model back as input, appending new tokens one at a time:

```python
import torch

generated = input_ids  # Tensor that stores all generated tokens
max_length = 50  # Maximum length of the output sequence

with torch.no_grad():  # No need to calculate gradients
    while generated.shape[1] < max_length:
        outputs = model(generated)  # Get model output for the current sequence
        next_token_logits = outputs.logits[:, -1, :]  # Get the logits of the last token
        next_token = torch.argmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1).unsqueeze(0)  # Pick the most likely next token
        generated = torch.cat((generated, next_token.unsqueeze(0)), dim=1)  # Append generated token

# Decode the generated tokens to a string
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(generated.squeeze().tolist())
print(generated_text)

```
