What are tensors?

- Tensors are a fundamental data structure used in the fields of machine learning and deep learning. They are similar to arrays and matrices, representing a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. In the context of programming, a tensor can be thought of as an n-dimensional array or list.
