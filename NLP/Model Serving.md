- The basic meaning of model serving is to **host machine-learning models** (on the cloud or on premises) and to make their functions available via API so that applications can incorporate AI into their systems. Model serving is crucial, as a business cannot offer AI products to a large user base without making its product accessible.
- Any machine-learning application ends with a deployed model.Â  Some require simple deployments, yet others involve more complex pipelines. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM provide tools to make it easier to deploy machine-learning models as web services. Moreover, advanced tools can automate tedious workflows to build your machine-learning model services.
