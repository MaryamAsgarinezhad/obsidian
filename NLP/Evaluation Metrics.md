- BLEU is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one natural language to another.

- While BLEU score is primarily used for machine translation tasks, ROUGE score is used for text summarization tasks. Both metrics rely on n-gram overlap to measure similarity between the machine-generated output and the reference translations or summaries.
