An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or feature learning. More abstractly, an autoencoder learns to represent the input data in a compressed format and then reconstructs the output from this representation, aiming to match the original input as closely as possible.

### Structure of an Autoencoder

The architecture of an autoencoder can be broadly divided into two parts:

1. **Encoder**: This part of the network compresses the input into a latent-space representation. It learns to encode the input data into a smaller, dense representation, which is a compressed version of the input data. The encoder transforms the high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional code.
    
2. **Decoder**: This component of the network reconstructs the input data from the compressed code to replicate the original input as closely as possible. Essentially, it learns to perform the reverse operation of the encoder, turning the reduced encoded data back into a version that as closely resembles the original input as possible.
