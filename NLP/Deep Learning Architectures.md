The Autoregressive Model, or AR model for short, relies only on past period values to predict current ones. It's a linear model, where current period values are a sum of past outcomes multiplied by a numeric factor.

Autoregressive modeling is an important component of large language models (LLMs).

ChatGPT is an autoregressive model due to which it only considers the left context while making predictions.

CONSIDER THIS IN WRITING PROMPTS

------------------------------------------

The error message is indicating that the model.generate() method is being called on an instance of BertModel, which does not have a language generation head. This means it cannot be used for generating text as you are attempting to do. You need to use a model that supports text generation, such as BertLMHeadModel, GPT-2, GPT-3, etc. Make sure you are using a model that has a language modeling head.

BERT-based models, including BertLMHeadModel, are generally limited to input sequences of 512 tokens due to the model's architecture. The error indicates that the tokenized input length is exceeding this limit. This limitation means that any sequence you pass to the model must be trimmed or segmented to fit within this constraint.
