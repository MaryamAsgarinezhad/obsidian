Pipelines in the context of the Hugging Face Transformers library are high-level abstractions designed to make it easier and faster to **use pre-trained models** for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. They handle much of the complexity associated with setting up models for inference, including loading pre-trained weights, setting up model configurations, and managing tokenization and input/output processing.
