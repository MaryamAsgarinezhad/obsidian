This section introduces several key components, including a ResNet-based architecture, an adaptive loss balancing function, and the **Adan optimizer**, which is a more recent optimization algorithm for deep learning tasks.


### **1. ResNet Class**

#### **Purpose:**

This is a wrapper around a ResNet-18 model (from the `timm` library) that integrates ResNet into your custom pipeline, adapting it to handle specific input dimensions and tasks like classification.

#### **Key Features:**

- **Pretrained ResNet-18 Backbone:**
    - The model uses the ResNet-18 architecture as a feature extractor, pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **Input and Output Customization:**
    - `input_channels`: Adapts the input to handle channels other than the default 3 (RGB images).
    - `num_classes`: Sets the number of output classes for the task.

#### **Forward Pass:**

```python
def forward(self, x):
    x = x.permute(0, 3, 1, 2)  # Rearrange dimensions to match ResNet's expected input (B, C, H, W)
    return self.resnet(x)      # Pass through ResNet
```

#### **Use Case:**

- This architecture can be used for tasks like classification or feature extraction from time-series data that are reshaped into 2D-like structures.

### **2. Adaptive Loss Balancing (`relobralo`)**

#### **Purpose:**

The function **`relobralo`** ==dynamically balances two loss terms, allowing the model to emphasize one loss term over the other during training==. This is useful in multi-task learning or scenarios where losses operate at different scales.

#### **How It Works:**

- **Inputs:**
    
    - `loss_u` and `loss_f`: Two loss terms to balance (e.g., data loss and physics loss).
    - `alpha`: Balancing factor controlling the trade-off between the two losses.
    - `l0` and `l1`: Normalization factors for the losses.
    - `lam`: Initial weights for the losses.
    - `T`: Temperature parameter to control the softmax sharpness.
    - `rho`: Weight for the previous loss weights (`lam`).
- **Core Steps:**
    
    1. **Normalize Losses:** Use `l0` and `l1` to scale the losses.
    2. **Softmax Attention:** Compute softmax weights for each loss term using the normalized values.
    3. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Combine the softmax weights and initial weights `lam` to compute the final weights for each loss.

#### **Output:**

- Returns a list of dynamically adjusted loss weights (`lambs`).

#### **Use Case:**

- Allows the model to adaptively balance conflicting objectives, such as data consistency and physics-based constraints.

### **3. Adan Optimizer**

#### **Purpose:**

**Adan** is a new optimizer designed to improve optimization speed and generalization in deep learning models. It builds upon ideas from optimizers like Adam and introduces additional mechanisms for **momentum correction** and **gradient difference updates**.

### **How These Pieces Fit Together**

1. **Model Backbone**:
    
    - Use `ResNet` or other architectures to process inputs and extract features.
2. **Loss Balancing**:
    
    - Use `relobralo` to dynamically balance loss terms, allowing for flexible training strategies.
3. **Optimization**:
    
    - Use the **Adan optimizer** for faster convergence and improved generalization compared to traditional optimizers.
