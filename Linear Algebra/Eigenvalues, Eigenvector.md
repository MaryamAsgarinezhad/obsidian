### **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**

![[Pasted image 20250124181546.png]]
**Key Points:**

- Eigenvectors indicate the ==directions== that are stretched or compressed by the ==transformation represented by A.==
- Eigenvalues measure how much the eigenvector is stretched or compressed.

**Multiplying B by A:**

If A has eigenvalues λ1​,λ2​,… and eigenvectors v1,v2​,…, these eigenvalues and eigenvectors influence the effect of AB on the structure of B.
