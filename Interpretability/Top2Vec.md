​Top2Vec, an innovative algorithm for topic modeling and semantic search that leverages ==joint document== and ==word embeddings== to identify topics within a corpus **without extensive preprocessing or prior knowledge of topic quantity**.​

**Background**

Traditional topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), often rely on bag-of-words representations. These methods ignore word order and semantics, necessitating preprocessing steps like stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. Additionally, they typically require the number of topics to be specified beforehand. These limitations can lead to less informative topic representations.​[arXiv+3arXiv+3gmarti.gitlab.io+3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09470)[Semantic Scholar+3gmarti.gitlab.io+3arXiv+3](https://gmarti.gitlab.io/ml/2021/11/14/top2vec-10k-business.html)

In contrast, distributed representations, as seen in models like word2vec and doc2vec, capture semantic relationships between words and documents. Building upon these advancements, Top2Vec aims to address the shortcomings of traditional methods by utilizing semantic embeddings for more accurate and automated topic discovery.​[rdrr.io+4arXiv+4Wikipedia+4](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2008.09470)[gmarti.gitlab.io](https://gmarti.gitlab.io/ml/2021/11/14/top2vec-10k-business.html)

**Methodology**

Top2Vec operates through the following key steps:​

1. **Joint Embedding of Documents and Words**: The algorithm begins by creating a semantic space where both document and word vectors are embedded. This is achieved using models like doc2vec, which learn vector representations that capture semantic similarities.​[gmarti.gitlab.io+9arXiv+9GitHub+9](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2008.09470)
    
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: To manage the high-dimensional nature of the embeddings, Top2Vec employs Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce the dimensionality, facilitating the identification of dense clusters.​[gmarti.gitlab.io](https://gmarti.gitlab.io/ml/2021/11/14/top2vec-10k-business.html)
    
3. **Clustering**: Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) is then applied to the reduced embeddings to detect dense regions, each representing a potential topic.​
    
4. **Topic Vector Calculation**: For each identified cluster, a centroid is computed in the original high-dimensional space, serving as the topic vector. This vector represents the central theme of the documents within that cluster.​[GitHub+1Wikipedia+1](https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec)
    
5. **Topic Representation**: The algorithm identifies words whose embeddings are closest to each topic vector, designating them as the representative words for that topic.​[arXiv+5ResearchGate+5R Project Search+5](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343825670_Top2Vec_Distributed_Representations_of_Topics)

- **Minimal Preprocessing**: There is no need for stop-word lists, stemming, or lemmatization, simplifying the preprocessing pipeline.​[GitHub+4Semantic Scholar+4arXiv+4](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Top2Vec%3A-Distributed-Representations-of-Topics-Angelov/fda2a8b03fb15a2d8b5c5aeb01d1c0b27f0b006b)
    
- **Semantic Richness**: By leveraging semantic embeddings, Top2Vec captures nuanced relationships between words and documents, leading to more informative and representative topics.​[arXiv+1arXiv+1](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2008.09470)
    
- **Scalability**: The method is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for extensive corpora.​
