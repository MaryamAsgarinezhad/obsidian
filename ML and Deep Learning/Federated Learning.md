Federated learning is a distributed approach to machine learning where the model is trained across multiple devices or servers holding local data, without sharing the data itself.

Federated learning (often referred to as collaborative learning) is **a decentralized approach to training machine learning models**. It doesn't require an exchange of data from client devices to global servers. Instead, the raw data on edge devices is used to train the model locally, increasing data privacy.

Wrapping up, we can say that distributed learning is about having centralized data but distributing the model training to different nodes, while **federated learning is about having decentralized data and training and in effect having a central model**.
