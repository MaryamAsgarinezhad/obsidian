The paper proposes a hybrid model for predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of rolling bearings in machinery, a critical task for enhancing operational reliability and reducing maintenance costs. This new framework, called **DSCN-AttnPINN**, combines **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** with **Deep Separable Convolutional Networks (DSCN)** and self-attention mechanisms. 


In the uploaded paper, **DSCN** is used as the feature extraction module for predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of machinery components. Its role includes:

- Mapping raw multi-sensor vibration data into a **hidden state** (intermediate feature maps generated by convolutional layers) representation.
- Learning features without manual preprocessing or feature engineering.
- Enhancing interpretability and efficiency by integrating separable convolutions and SE units.


In the context of the uploaded paper, **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** play a crucial role in bridging the gap between purely data-driven approaches (like deep learning) and physics-based modeling for predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of rolling bearings.

- For rolling bearings, this involves incorporating relationships between sensor data, degradation patterns, and RUL as dditional constraints derived from the physical behavior of the system.
- By encoding physical laws, the PINN ensures that the predictions are not just accurate but also ==interpretable== in terms of real-world physics.

### **3. How the PINN Works in This Article**

The paper extends standard PINNs by integrating:

1. **Feature Extraction (from DSCN)**:
    
    - The hidden state from the **Deep Separable Convolutional Network (DSCN)** is passed to the PINN as input.
    - This hidden state represents features extracted directly from sensor data.
2. **Physics Constraints via PDEs**:
    
    - A special **Deep Hidden Physics Model (==DeepHPM==)** is incorporated into the PINN to handle implicit relationships between degradation patterns and sensor data.
    - The DeepHPM uses partial derivatives (computed using automatic differentiation) to represent physical constraints.
3. **Loss Function**:
    
    - The PINN’s loss function balances:
        - **Data-driven loss**: Matches predictions to the ground truth RUL.
        - **Physics-based loss**: Ensures predictions adhere to physics laws (e.g., degradation dynamics).

The loss function is:

#### **How Are Rolling Bearing Faults Diagnosed?**

Traditionally, fault diagnosis is done through **vibration analysis**, which involves monitoring the **vibrations generated by the bearings** and identifying **anomalies** that indicate potential faults.

There are three **main types of rolling bearing faults**:

|**Fault Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Inner Race Fault**|A crack or wear inside the bearing ring (most common)|
|**Outer Race Fault**|A defect on the outer ring of the bearing|
|**Rolling Element Fault**|A fault in the rolling balls (or rollers) of the bearing|

These faults create **unique vibration signatures** that can be analyzed using **time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency methods**.
