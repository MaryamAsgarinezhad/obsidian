### **Code Explanation**

#### **1. `TrainDataset` Class**

This class is designed to:

1. Combine data from multiple bearings into a single dataset.
2. Allow seamless access to samples from all included bearings through indexing.

```python
def __init__(self, root_dir, bearings, window_size=3, degredation_start=20, interval_length=16, upsampling_repetition=4, test=False):
    """
    Combine multiple XJTU_SY_Bearing_Dataset into one dataset.
    """
    self.datasets = [
        XJTU_SY_Bearing_Dataset(
            root_dir, bearing, window_size, degredation_start, interval_length, upsampling_repetition, test
        )
        for bearing in bearings
    ]
    self.each_num_samples = [len(dataset) for dataset in self.datasets]
    self.num_samples = sum(self.each_num_samples)

```

- **Inputs:**
    
    - `root_dir`: Directory containing the vibration signal files.
    - `bearings`: List of bearing IDs to include in the dataset (e.g., `[2, 3, 4, 5]` for training).
    - `window_size`, `degredation_start`, `interval_length`, `upsampling_repetition`, `test`: Same as in `XJTU_SY_Bearing_Dataset`.
- **Key Operations:**
    
    1. **Create Sub-Datasets:**
        
        - ==`self.datasets`== contains a separate `XJTU_SY_Bearing_Dataset` instance for each bearing in `bearings`.
        - Example: If `bearings = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, this creates 4 datasets, each corresponding to a different bearing.
    2. **Compute Sample Sizes:**
        
        - ==`self.each_num_samples`==: A list storing the number of samples in each sub-dataset.
            - Example: `[100, 150, 120, 130]` if the datasets for bearings 2, 3, 4, and 5 have these sizes.
        - `self.num_samples`: The total number of samples across all sub-datasets (sum of `self.each_num_samples`).
            - Example: 100+150+120+130=500100 + 150 + 120 + 130 = 500100+150+120+130=500.


### **Why This Structure?**

1. **Training Dataset:**
    
    - Combines multiple bearings to improve the model's ability to generalize across different conditions.
    - Upsamples degraded signals for better representation in the training dataset.
2. **Testing Dataset:**
    
    - Evaluates the model on a single bearing (bearing `1`) to measure its performance on unseen data.
