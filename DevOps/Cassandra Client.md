`sessionManager`: Manages Cassandra sessions, responsible for executing queries.

**Constructor:**

- The constructor initializes the session manager, prepares the insert statement, and sets up the query strings for fetching data from Cassandra.

**`start()`, `isStarted()`, `isReady()`, `close()`:**
- Lifecycle management methods for the client, including starting, checking readiness, and closing the session.

------------------------------------

**`put(KeyValueStoredObject storedObject)`:**
- Compresses the object data, splits it into chunks, and writes each chunk to Cassandra.

**`writChunk(String chunkId, byte[] data, int objectSize, String checksum)`:**
- Writes a single chunk to Cassandra, with retry logic up to `MAX_RETRY` times.

**`get(String objectKey)`:**
- Retrieves and reconstructs the object by reading its chunks from Cassandra.

**`getWithTimestamp(String objectKey)`:**
- Similar to `get`, but returns the object along with its timestamp. The timestamp handling is not fully implemented.

**`delete(String key)`:**
- Placeholder method indicating that the actual delete operation may be handled by TTL (Time to Live) or compaction in Cassandra.

**`readChunk(String chunkId)`:**
- Reads a single chunk from Cassandra using the `chunkId`. If reading fails, it retries up to `MAX_RETRY` times.

### Key Points: the denominator becomes very large.
 the denominator becomes very large.
- **Chunking**: Large objects are split into smaller chunks to fit within Cassandra's constraints.
- **Compression**: Data is compressed before storage to save space and reduce I/O.
- **Retry Logic**: Operations are retried upon failure, with metrics collected to monitor success and failure rates.
- **Metrics**: Extensive use of metrics allows monitoring the performance and reliability of the client.
- **Thread Safety**: The `CassandraClient` is implemented as a singleton (using double-checked locking), ensuring only one instance is created even in a multithreaded environment.

----------------------------------------

Implementing the `StorageClient` interface provides several benefits, particularly in terms of design flexibility, code organization, and enforceable contracts for any storage-related operations within a system. Here are the key benefits:

### 1. **Enforces a Standard Contract:**

- By implementing the `StorageClient` interface, any class must adhere to a standard contract that defines core operations like `put`, `get`, and `delete`.
- This ensures consistency across different implementations, whether they are interacting with Cassandra, a different database, or even a mock storage system.

### 2. **Abstraction and Flexibility:**

- The interface abstracts the underlying storage mechanism. The client code that interacts with `StorageClient` doesn't need to know whether the storage backend is a database, a file system, or an in-memory store.
- This allows swapping out the storage implementation without changing the client code, promoting flexibility and easier maintenance.

### 3. **Type Safety with Generics:**

- The use of generics (`T extends StoredObject, K, V`) allows type-safe operations.
- `T` ensures that only objects of types extending `StoredObject` can be passed, while `K` and `V` define the key and value types, respectively. This prevents errors and improves code readability.

### 4. **Extensibility:**

- New storage mechanisms can be introduced by simply creating new classes that implement the `StorageClient` interface. This allows for easy extensibility as new storage systems or techniques evolve.
- For instance, if you later decide to use a different database or a distributed cache, you can create a new implementation of `StorageClient` for that system without modifying existing code.

### 5. **Integration with Other Components (Startable Interface):**

- The `StorageClient` interface extends `Startable`, which likely defines lifecycle methods like `start()`, `close()`, and `isReady()`.
- This means any storage client implementation must also manage its lifecycle, ensuring that resources are properly initialized and cleaned up, which is crucial for systems that interact with external resources like databases.

### 6. **Facilitates Testing and Mocking:**

- Interfaces are easier to mock than concrete classes, making unit testing simpler. You can create mock implementations of `StorageClient` for testing purposes, isolating your tests from the actual storage layer.
- This reduces dependencies on the actual storage backend during testing, making tests faster and more reliable.

### 7. **Provides Default Constants:**

- The `StorageClient` interface provides a default constant (`byte[] EMPTY_CONTENT = new byte[0];`), which can be used across implementations to standardize the return value when no content is found.
- This avoids duplication of such constants across multiple implementations.

### 8. **Ensures Consistency Across Different Implementations:**

- Since all implementations must provide the methods defined in the interface, it ensures that the behavior of `put`, `get`, and `delete` is consistent, regardless of the specific storage mechanism used.

### Summary:

Implementing the `StorageClient` interface in your `CassandraClient` (or any other class) provides a well-defined, type-safe, and consistent way to interact with various storage backends. It promotes code reuse, flexibility, ease of testing, and overall system design clarity. This interface acts as a contract that guarantees all storage clients provide the same core functionalities, making the system more maintainable and extensible.

**Mocking in unit tests**

### Why Mocking is Commonly Used:

1. **Isolation:** Mocking is typically used to isolate the component under test from its dependencies. For instance, if the `CassandraClient` interacts with a real database, mocking allows you to test the client without needing a real database connection, which can make tests faster and more reliable.
    
2. **Control:** By mocking dependencies, you can control their behavior, such as forcing errors or specific return values, which allows you to test edge cases and error handling in your code.
    
3. **Environment Independence:** Mocking makes tests more independent of the environment. For example, you don't need access to an actual database or an external service, which makes the tests easier to run in different environments, such as on a CI/CD server or a developer's local machine.
