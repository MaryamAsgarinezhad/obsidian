#  Brown et al. (2020), “Language Models are Few-Shot Learners

GPT-3 attends to _all_ tokens in that prompt to decide how to generate the next token. Thus, a multi-turn conversation can be constructed by continually appending each user query and the model’s response back into the text prompt (until the 2048-token limit is reached).

##  In-Context Learning (Few-Shot, One-Shot, Zero-Shot)

### What the Paper Says

- A **core contribution** of Brown et al. (2020) is the concept that ==_no parameter updates== are needed_ for GPT-3 to perform tasks if you provide examples of the task in the input text. They call this _==in-context learning_.==
- For instance, if you want GPT-3 to act as a question-answering system, you can include a handful of (Question, Answer) examples in the prompt. GPT-3 then infers _from context alone_ what it should do for the next query.

### Relevance to “Chat History”

- In a chat-like scenario, you can treat each (User query, GPT-3 response) pair as _one example_ in the prompt. Once you provide a few such pairs, the model learns the “pattern” and continues the “chat” style.
- ==The user’s next question is appended after these pairs, and GPT-3 produces an answer based on everything it has “seen” so far.== This procedure is exactly the same as how GPT-3 does few-shot learning for other tasks—it’s just that your demonstration examples happen to be question-answer pairs or dialogue turns.

## No Separate “Memory”—All History is in the Prompt

### What the Paper Says

- ==GPT-3 is _purely autoregressive_==: it does not maintain an internal state or memory beyond the hidden state computed from the current prompt. In other words, if something isn’t _in_ that prompt text, the model has no direct record of it.
- This means the model can handle or “remember” earlier parts of a conversation only if they still appear in the context window (i.e., if they haven’t been truncated).

### Relevance to “Chat History”

- Any “chat memory” must be preserved by _including it in the prompt._ If you omit older messages, GPT-3 no longer has direct access to them.
- Brown et al. do not specifically address how to manage extremely long dialogues (beyond the 2048-token limit), but they do highlight that the maximum context length is a practical constraint for GPT-3’s usage.
- That sequence of (Q, A) pairs is the _context_ that GPT-3 uses. If you keep including more (Q, A) pairs over time, that entire history (within the 2048-token limit) influences how GPT-3 responds.
- Although the paper primarily uses the concept of _few-shot examples_, you can easily imagine substituting “User:” and “Assistant:” for “Q:” and “A:”, which is precisely how one might simulate or create a chat interface using GPT-3.

##  Handling Longer Histories or Summaries (Paper’s Limitations)

### What the Paper Says

- The authors acknowledge that the model has a fixed maximum sequence length. Beyond noting the 2048-token limit, the paper does not propose a built-in mechanism for summarizing or chunking long contexts.
- The paper also does not address how to _selectively_ preserve or compress older conversation history, though such techniques (like summarizing prior turns) are common in practice.

### Relevance to “Chat History”

- In practical chatbot usage with GPT-3, developers often implement a _rolling window_ or a _summary mechanism_ to ==keep the model within token limits.==
- Brown et al. focus more on the phenomenon that GPT-3 can _learn in context_ rather than how to scale that learning across very long dialogues.

## 1. ChatGPT is Trained for Dialogue

### What the Post Says

- **ChatGPT is described as a sibling model to InstructGPT** that has been _fine-tuned_ to engage in _multi-turn conversation_.
- It is trained using a dialogue format: during training data collection, labelers played the role of both user and AI assistant.

### Relevance to Chat History

- ==Because ChatGPT’s training data includes _dialogue snippets_ and _multi-turn interactions_, the model is naturally oriented toward referencing _prior user inputs and prior model outputs_ when generating new responses.==
- This is distinct from older, single-turn GPT models, as ChatGPT’s fine-tuning process directly conditions it to handle conversation history rather than just a single query.

### What the Post Implies

- While the blog post does _not_ describe the full technical implementation, it strongly implies that ChatGPT sees **each message in the conversation** as sequential text input—sometimes described as a “prompt” or “token sequence.”
    
- In each new turn, ChatGPT’s input includes:
    
    1. The conversation instructions or system messages (internal or user-facing guidelines).
    2. The user’s previous messages.
    3. The assistant’s previous answers.
    4. The user’s latest query.
- ChatGPT then produces its next response **autoregressively**, attending to all tokens (i.e., the entire visible conversation) within the model’s context window.

## Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Role of Context

### What the Post Says

- The blog mentions that ChatGPT was ==trained with **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**==, building on the approach introduced in InstructGPT.
- Human feedback shapes how ChatGPT responds to different prompts, ensuring it follows instructions, remains helpful, and avoids disallowed content.

### Relevance to Chat History

- While RLHF does _not_ directly alter _how_ ChatGPT sees prior conversation turns, it **influences how ChatGPT weighs and interprets** the context.
- Through RLHF, the model learns to produce contextually appropriate answers (e.g., staying on topic, being consistent with prior statements), because human labelers typically provided feedback on multi-turn dialogues during training.

- In practice, older parts of the conversation can be **truncated** if the text exceeds this limit, although the blog doesn’t address the mechanics of how or when that happens.
- The _interface_ automatically appends the user’s messages and ChatGPT’s outputs to the conversation. This means that from ChatGPT’s perspective, it sees the entire series of messages as a continuous dialogue each time it generates a new response.
