### **Key Takeaways:**

1. **Diagonalizability depends on eigenvectors and eigenvalues, not directly on rank.**
2. A matrix can have full rank but still not be diagonalizable (e.g., defective matrices).
3. ==Rank influences diagonalizability indirectly because it determines the dimension of the null space (eigenspaces are part of the null space of A−λI==.

This equation means that:

- v is a nonzero vector in the **null space** of A−λ.
- In other words, the eigenvectors corresponding to λ are precisely the vectors in the null space of A−λ.
