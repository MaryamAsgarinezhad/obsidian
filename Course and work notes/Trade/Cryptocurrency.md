Cryptocurrency is a kind of digital currency that works on blockchain technology.

What's the difference between cryptocurrency and other currencies?

- It's decentralized.
- Free from any third party interferance.
- A cryptocurrency transaction is never failed.
- It has no to little transaction cost.

How it works without the control of an external authority?

- It works based on the blockchain technology, which is a set of blocks that record the information of each transaction (who made the transaction to whom, the amount of trade in the form of a digital ledger that is distributed across the entire network, meaning the data is replicated and stored on each node across the entire blockchain network, making it more secure and impossible to change, hack, or cheat a system)

- Then it is verified and validated by every node to proceed with the process of  making transactions. 
- Hashing agorithms are used to secure this process.

- These transactions are validated and then added block by block.
  Those who validate these blocks are called **miners**.
  There are two steps that miners do : 
  1- Proof of work
  2- mining
