**ETL** stands for “Extract, Transform, and Load.” It is a set of common processes for collecting, integrating, and distributing data to make it available for additional purposes, such as analytics, machine learning, reporting, or other business purposes. ETL enables an organization to carry out data-driven analysis and decision-making using operational data.

### **1. Kafka Topic**

- A **topic** in Kafka is a logical channel or category to which producers send data and from which consumers read data.
- Think of it as a named stream of records/messages.
- Kafka topics are:
    - **Partitioned**: Each topic is divided into partitions for scalability and parallelism.
    - **Durable**: Messages in a topic can be retained for a configurable amount of time.

Example:

- A topic named `orders` could contain all the order-related messages for an e-commerce platform.

### **2. Kafka Broker**

- A **broker** is a Kafka server that stores data and serves client requests for publishing and consuming messages.
- Kafka brokers form a **Kafka cluster**:
    - Each broker is identified by a unique ID.
    - They work together to ==distribute partitions== across the cluster for fault tolerance and load balancing.

Example:

- A Kafka cluster might have three brokers: `broker1:9092`, `broker2:9092`, and `broker3:9092`.

### **3. Kafka Group Name (Consumer Group)**

- A **consumer group** is a set of consumers that work together to read messages from a topic.
- Kafka ensures that each message is delivered to only one consumer within a group:
    - If a topic has 3 partitions and a consumer group has 3 consumers, each consumer will read from one partition.
    - If there are more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be idle.
- ==Group names allow multiple consumer groups to read from the same topic independently.==

Example:

- A consumer group named `payment-processing` could consist of multiple consumers responsible for handling payment-related messages.

### **4. Kafka Schema**

- A **schema** defines the structure of the data in Kafka messages.
- Common schema formats include:
    - **Avro**
    - **Protobuf**
    - **JSON Schema**
- The schema ensures that producers and consumers agree on the data format, enabling data validation and compatibility.

Example:

- An Avro schema for a `user` message might define fields like `id`, `name`, and `email`.

### **5. Consumer Group**

- A **consumer group** is a logical group of consumers that coordinate to consume messages from a topic.
- Characteristics:
    - Consumers in the same group share the workload by dividing partitions among themselves.
    - Kafka tracks the last read message (offset) for each partition in the group.


### **6. Producer Group**

- A **producer group** is a logical grouping of Kafka producers, though it's less formalized than consumer groups.
- Producers are responsible for sending messages to topics.
- While there isn’t a strict Kafka concept of "producer groups," producers can coordinate to write data in a certain way (e.g., using the same partitioning strategy).

Example:

- Multiple producers in a producer group might send messages to a topic `website-logs`, ==ensuring all logs from the same user go to the same partition.==


Each partition in a Kafka topic is assigned to a specific consumer **within a consumer group**. Producers determine which partition a message goes to, but the mapping is typically less strict than for consumers.

- **Consumers**: Partitions are strictly assigned to one consumer in a group, ensuring no duplication and balanced workload.
- **Producers**: Partitions are chosen based on the message key, round-robin logic, or custom partitioning. Producers don’t directly map themselves to specific partitions like consumers do in groups.

A **Kafka Materialized View** in **ClickHouse** is a specialized feature that allows you to automatically process and store data consumed from a Kafka topic into a **storage table** in ClickHouse. It acts as a pipeline that connects a Kafka engine table (which streams data from Kafka) to a storage table.

### **How Kafka Materialized Views Work**

1. **Kafka Engine Table**:
    
    - A table with the `Kafka` engine that consumes raw data from a Kafka topic.
    - It acts as a buffer, streaming messages from Kafka but does not persist them.
2. **Materialized View**:
    
    - A persistent view that listens to the Kafka engine table.
    - Transforms the data (if needed) and inserts it into a storage table (e.g., a `MergeTree` table).
    - Automatically applies the defined transformation logic and ensures data is stored efficiently in ClickHouse.
3. **Storage Table**:
    
    - A table (usually `MergeTree`) where the processed data is stored for querying.
    - This table is populated through the materialized view.

---------------

In the context of integrating Kafka with ClickHouse, ==two types of tables== are used, and each serves a distinct role:

### **1. Kafka Engine Table**

#### **Purpose**

- Acts as an **entry point** to consume streaming data from Kafka.
- Temporary or transient: It does not persist data itself.
- Designed to continuously read messages from Kafka topics and make them available for further processing.

#### **Key Characteristics**

- **Streaming Focus**:
    
    - Reads data in ==real-time== from Kafka topics.
    - Data is processed in memory or forwarded immediately.
- **Not Persistent**:
    
    - It does not store data long-term.
    - Acts more like a pipe or a buffer between Kafka and ClickHouse.
- **Configurations**:
    
    - Includes settings for ==Kafka brokers, topics, consumer groups, and data format (`kafka_format`)==.
    - Ensures data is correctly consumed from Kafka.

### **2. MergeTree Table**

#### **Purpose**

- A **persistent storage table** in ClickHouse.
- Stores the processed data from the ==Kafka Engine Table or Materialized View==.
- Optimized for high-performance querying and analytics.

#### **Key Characteristics**

- **Persistent and Durable**:
    
    - Data is stored on disk.
    - Retains data for as long as necessary, depending on business requirements.
- **Queryable**:
    
    - Supports querying with SQL for analytics, reporting, or dashboards.
- **Highly Optimized**:
    
    - Uses the **MergeTree engine**, which is designed for high-performance columnar storage.
    - Supports partitioning, primary key sorting, and compression for efficient queries.
- **Schema-Defined**:
    
    - You define the structure of the data to be stored (e.g., column names, types, sorting key).

Comparison:

#### **SQL Code (Kafka Engine Table + Materialized View)**:

- **Usage**: Defines and creates tables in ClickHouse to directly integrate with Kafka for consuming and storing data.
- **Scope**: It is specific to a particular ==ClickHouse table and Kafka topic==. The settings apply only to the Kafka engine table you create.
- **Dynamic Data Processing**:
    - Automatically reads from Kafka topics.
    - Inserts data into a ClickHouse storage table using a materialized view.
    - Often used for specific pipelines or workloads.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE kafka_input
(
    text_input String,
    cleaned_text String,
    request_id String,
    wav_size_bytes UInt64,
    wav_data String,
    processing_time_seconds Float32,
)
ENGINE = Kafka()
SETTINGS
    kafka_broker_list = 'kafka:9092',
    kafka_topic_list = 'test',
    kafka_group_name = 'test_consumer_group',
    kafka_format = 'JSONEachRow',
    kafka_num_consumers = 1,
    kafka_max_block_size = 1000,
    kafka_skip_broken_messages = 5;

CREATE TABLE clickhouse_table
(
    text_input String,
    cleaned_text String,
    request_id String,
    wav_size_bytes UInt64,
    wav_data String,
    processing_time_seconds Float32,
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY request_id;

-- insert data from Kafka into ClickHouse
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW kafka_to_clickhouse
TO clickhouse_table
AS
SELECT
    text_input,
    cleaned_text,
    request_id,
    wav_size_bytes,
    wav_data,
    processing_time_seconds
FROM kafka_input;


-- delete tables and materialized view if needed
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS kafka_to_clickhouse;
DROP TABLE clickhouse_table;
```

#### **Configuration File**:

- **Usage**: Sets **global or topic-specific** Kafka engine settings for the entire ClickHouse instance or multiple tables.
- **Scope**: Applies globally or across multiple Kafka tables, controlling how ClickHouse interacts with Kafka topics at a broader level.
- **Static Settings**:
    - Used to manage overall Kafka behavior (e.g., global logging, offsets, retry policies).
    - Handles reusable topic-specific settings without redefining them in every SQL query.

```xml
  <kafka>
    <!-- Global configuration options for all tables of Kafka engine type -->
    <debug>cgrp</debug>
    <statistics_interval_ms>3000</statistics_interval_ms>

    <kafka_topic>
        <name>logs</name>
        <statistics_interval_ms>4000</statistics_interval_ms>
    </kafka_topic>

    <!-- Settings for consumer -->
    <consumer>
        <auto_offset_reset>smallest</auto_offset_reset>
        <kafka_topic>
            <name>logs</name>
            <fetch_min_bytes>100000</fetch_min_bytes>
        </kafka_topic>

        <kafka_topic>
            <name>stats</name>
            <fetch_min_bytes>50000</fetch_min_bytes>
        </kafka_topic>
    </consumer>

    <!-- Settings for producer -->
    <producer>
        <kafka_topic>
            <name>logs</name>
            <retry_backoff_ms>250</retry_backoff_ms>
        </kafka_topic>

        <kafka_topic>
            <name>stats</name>
            <retry_backoff_ms>400</retry_backoff_ms>
        </kafka_topic>
    </producer>
  </kafka>
```

In the context of Kafka, **ZooKeeper** plays a critical role in managing and coordinating the Kafka cluster. 

### **Role of ZooKeeper in Kafka**

1. **Cluster Management**
    
    - ZooKeeper keeps track of all the brokers (nodes) in the Kafka cluster.
    - It helps maintain a list of active brokers and ensures that new brokers can join the cluster dynamically.
2. **Leader Election**
    
    - For every Kafka topic, its partitions need a leader broker. ZooKeeper facilitates the election of partition leaders when:
        - A Kafka broker starts.
        - A broker fails or goes offline.
    - This ensures high availability by reassigning leadership to another broker if needed.
3. **Configuration Management**
    
    - ZooKeeper stores metadata about topics, partitions, and their configurations.
    - Brokers can retrieve this information to ensure consistency across the cluster.
4. **State Management**
    
    - ZooKeeper helps track the state of Kafka partitions and their replicas:
        - Which replicas are in sync with the leader.
        - Which brokers hold which replicas.
5. **Distributed Coordination**
    
    - Kafka uses ZooKeeper to coordinate tasks among brokers, such as:
        - Assigning partitions to brokers.
        - Balancing load when new brokers are added.
        - Managing distributed locks.
6. **Broker Health Monitoring**
    
    - Kafka uses ZooKeeper to detect when a broker goes offline or becomes unresponsive. If a broker fails, ZooKeeper triggers reassignments or re-elections.

---

### **Why Kafka Depends on ZooKeeper**

ZooKeeper provides the mechanisms Kafka needs for:

- **Fault Tolerance**: By managing leader elections and broker health.
- **==Distributed Systems Coordination==**: Ensuring all nodes in the Kafka cluster operate in sync.
- **Simplified Communication**: By acting as a central store of metadata, ZooKeeper simplifies how brokers interact.

### **1. Start Kafka in KRaft Mode**

If you're using the **Bitnami Kafka Docker image**, you can configure it to use KRaft mode instead of ZooKeeper. Update your `docker-compose.yml` file like this:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  kafka:
    image: bitnami/kafka:latest
    container_name: kafka
    environment:
      - KAFKA_CFG_NODE_ID=1
      - KAFKA_CFG_PROCESS_ROLES=controller,broker
      - KAFKA_CFG_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS=1@localhost:9093
      - KAFKA_CFG_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://:9092,CONTROLLER://:9093
      - KAFKA_CFG_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT
      - KAFKA_CFG_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME=PLAINTEXT
      - KAFKA_CFG_LOG_DIRS=/tmp/kraft-combined-logs
      - KAFKA_CFG_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1
      - KAFKA_CFG_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1
      - KAFKA_CFG_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR=1
      - ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
```

This configuration runs Kafka in **KRaft mode**, where ZooKeeper is not needed.

### **2. Access the Kafka Console**

Use Docker's `exec` command to access the Kafka container:
```bash
docker exec -it kafka bash
```

Navigate to the Kafka tools directory:
```bash
cd /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin
```

### **3. Create a Test Topic**

In KRaft mode, you can still create topics as you would in a traditional setup:
```bash
./kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```
This command connects directly to the Kafka broker (not ZooKeeper) to create the topic.

### **4. Start the Kafka Console Producer**

Use the console producer to send test messages to your topic:
```shell
./kafka-console-producer.sh --topic test --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```
Type your messages and press **Enter** to send them.

### **5. Start the Kafka Console Consumer**

To verify the messages are being sent correctly, open a new terminal and start a Kafka consumer:
```bash
docker exec -it kafka bash cd /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin ./kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning
```

The above three commands execute a java application that does the topic creation, producing and consuming.
==This can be done with any script from outside the kafka container.==
