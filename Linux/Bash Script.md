- The `apt` command in Linux is a package management tool used primarily in Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu. It is used to manage software packagesâ€”installing, updating, and removing them.

- vim/nano are text editors to change the contents of a given file:
  ```bash
    vim /etc/app.con
    ```
- cat command shows the contents in that file.
- The `grep` command in a bash script is used to search for a specific pattern in files or input streams.
- the second command recursively searches for the string "pattern" in all `.txt` files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
- the first command Search recursively in a directory.
  
  ```shell
grep -r "pattern" directory/
find . -name "*.txt" -exec grep "pattern" {} \
```
```
- The `wc` command in the shell is used to display the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in a file or standard input.

```shell
  
  wc [options] [file]
```
- `-l`: Prints the number of lines in the file.
- `-w`: Prints the number of words in the file.
- `-c`: Prints the number of bytes in the file.
- `-m`: Prints the number of characters in the file.
- `-L`: Prints the length of the longest line in the file.

The command reads the contents of `words.txt`, then filters the output to show only the lines that start with an uppercase letter. A pipe (`|`) is a command in Linux and Unix-like operating systems that allows you to use the output (stdout) of one command as the input (stdin) to another command.

```shell
cat words.txt | grep '^[A-Z]'

```
This file is used by Linux systems to configure DNS (Domain Name System) name resolution settings. By opening this file with Vim, you can view and modify the DNS configuration, such as specifying DNS servers and search domains.

```shell
vim /etc/resolve.conf
```
The /etc directory is almost used to store configuration file. For changing any config file:

```shell
nano /etc/proxychains.conf
```

Nano editor commands:
- CTRL + O : save
- Enter : Read only
- CTRL + X : exit

Directories /etc and /bin store config and exec files of the system.

To run an application on your linux using services, you have to have all services installed on your local machine (you can not use any image here, but have to install services like SQL):
