- The Git command in Linux is used for version control, allowing users to track changes to files and collaborate with others on projects.

**git init**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This command creates a new `.git` directory that stores the repository's metadata and configuration.


**git clone <repository>: Clones a remote Git repository to your local machine. This command creates a copy of the repository, including all files and commit history.


git add <file>: Adds a file or directory to the staging area. Files in the staging area are included in the next commit.


git commit -m "<message>": Commits the changes in the staging area to the repository. The `-m` flag is used to provide a commit message describing the changes.


git status: Displays the status of the working directory and staging area. This command shows which files are modified, which files are staged, and which files are untracked.


git diff: Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area. This command can be used to review changes before committing them.

git log: Displays the commit history of the repository. This command shows a list of commits, including the commit message, author, and timestamp.
