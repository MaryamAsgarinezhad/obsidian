- The Git command in Linux is used for version control, allowing users to track changes to files and collaborate with others on projects.

**git init**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This command creates a new `.git` directory that stores the repository's metadata and configuration.


**git clone <repository>: Clones a remote Git repository to your local machine. This command creates a copy of the repository, including all files and commit history.
