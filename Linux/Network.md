A network interface is a hardware or software component that enables a device to connect to a network. It provides the necessary communication between the device and the network, allowing the device to send and receive data. Network interfaces can be physical, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapters, or virtual, such as those created by virtualization software like VMware or VirtualBox. Each network interface has a unique identifier, typically called a MAC address, and can be configured with an IP address to facilitate communication over the network.
